- `replyId`: The ID of the message to reply to

**Example:**

```typescript
useEventListener(RnWatchConnect, "onMessageWithReply", (event) => {
  console.log("Message received:", event.message);
  RnWatchConnect.replyToMessage(event.replyId, {

## TypeScript Support

The module is fully typed and supports generic types for messages and replies. You can define your own types for messages and replies:

```typescript
// Define your message types
type MyMessage = {
  message: string;
  // ... other properties
};

type MyReply = {
  response: string;
  // ... other properties
};

// Use them in your code
const reply = await RnWatchConnect.sendMessage<MyMessage, MyReply>({
  message: "Hello",
});
```

## üìù Example

```typescript
import RnWatchConnect, { useEventListener } from "rn-watch-connect";

type MyMessage = {
  message: string;
};

type MyReply = {
  response: string;
};

function App() {
  // Listen for messages
  useEventListener<MyMessage>(
    RnWatchConnect,
    "onMessageReceived",
    ({ message }) => {
      console.log("Message received:", message);
    }
  );

  // Send a message
  const sendMessage = async () => {
    try {
      const reply = await RnWatchConnect.sendMessage<MyMessage, MyReply>({
        message: "Hello from iPhone!"
      });
      console.log("Reply:", reply);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    // ... your app UI
  );
}
```
