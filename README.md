# ‚åöÔ∏èüì± rn-watch-connect

A React Native module that enables smooth and reliable communication between an iOS app and its paired Apple Watch using Apple‚Äôs [WatchConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchconnectivity) framework. This library offers an easy-to-use interface for sending messages, transferring files, syncing data, and monitoring the connection status between the iPhone and Apple Watch ‚Äî all from a React Native app.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This module does **NOT** provide a way to build Apple Watch apps. A separate Watch app must still be developed using Swift or SwiftUI. This package is intended as a modern, actively maintained alternative to the previously available (but now outdated) React Native watch connectivity module.

üôå Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the module or add new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## TypeScript Support

The module is fully typed and supports generic types for messages and replies. You can define your own types for messages and replies:

```typescript
// Define your message types
type MyMessage = {
  message: string;
  // ... other properties
};

type MyReply = {
  response: string;
  // ... other properties
};

// Use them in your code
const reply = await RnWatchConnect.sendMessage<MyMessage, MyReply>({
  message: "Hello",
});
```
